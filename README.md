# JavaScript Essentials Project

## Overview
This repository contains two versions of a project created as part of a team assignment during college, focusing on JavaScript essentials. The first version was built using a combination of online tutorials and resources, while the second version was created without external help, based solely on our understanding of JavaScript concepts learned in class.

## Project Structure

### Version 1
The first version (`version-1`) of the project demonstrates the use of various JavaScript functionalities, enhanced with the help of multiple tutorials. This version includes several mini-projects, such as:
- **Calculator**: A simple calculator built using JavaScript.
- **Clock**: A real-time clock displaying the current time.
- **Currency Converter**: A tool for converting between currencies.
- **Drawing App**: A basic canvas-based drawing application.
- **Image Gallery**: An interactive image gallery with navigation controls.
- **Quiz**: A multiple-choice quiz implemented using JavaScript.
- **Quote Generator**: A random quote generator.
- **To-Do List**: A basic to-do list manager.

The directory also contains various images and resources used in the website's interface, along with the main HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

### Version 2
The second version (`version-2`) represents a simplified approach, where each team member focused on implementing specific functionalities without relying on external tutorials. The individual contributions include:
- **Abdulellah.html**
- **Ghassan.html**
- **INDEX.html** (Main entry point)
- **Mohammed.html**
- **Mubarek.html**
- **Yazed.html**

This version also includes a report (`Report.docx`), which summarizes the project work, challenges faced, and key learning outcomes.
